        <h2>Summary of the project</h2>
        <p>
            This project is an e-commerce platform that was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
            It was meant to provide customers with a user-friendly and engaging online shopping experience. <br>This web
            app features a fully functional cart where customers can checkout their added items, a homepage with featured
            items, a search functionality, and a slider that filters products according to price range.<br><br>
            
            The technology stacks used to develop the web application include client-side technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS, as well as jQuery, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome for simplifying client-side scripting and providing pre-built design
            templates and components. <br>Server-side technologies such as AJAX and JSON were also used to transmit data between the
            client and server, enabling the web application to update data dynamically without refreshing the page. <br>Git and GitHub
            were used for version control, allowing developers to track changes in the source code and collaborate effectively.<br><br>

        <h2>Project's purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>
            This project's main purpose  was to expand my programming knowledge by building and implementing a fully functional e-commerce platform where customers
            can browse through the products, add items to their cart, and checkout. <br>Another purpose was to provide an
            engaging user experience by featuring products on the homepage, allowing customers to explore all the products,
            providing a search functionality, and a slider that filters the products based on price. The two buttons within the
            product images provide customers with additional information about the product and allow them to add the product to
            their cart.

        <h2>Webstack and explanation</h2>
        <p>
            This web app was developed using a combination of client-side and server-side technologies. The
            client-side technologies include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which were used to create the user interface and implement
            the front-end functionality. <br>JavaScript was used for client-side scripting, providing dynamic functionality
            and interactivity to the web application. HTML was used for creating the structure and content of the web pages, while
            CSS was used for styling the web pages to provide a visually appealing and responsive design.<br><br>
            
            Additionally, jQuery and Bootstrap were used to simplify client-side scripting and provide pre-built design templates
            and components for building responsive web pages. Font Awesome was used to provide a collection of scalable vector icons
            to enhance the visual design of the web application.<br><br>
            
            On the server-side, AJAX and JSON were used to transmit data between the client and server,
            enabling the web application to update data dynamically without refreshing the page. <br>Git and GitHub were used for
            version control, allowing me to track changes in the source code. Visual
            Studio Code was used as a code editor to write, test, and debug the source code.<br><br>

        <h2>Challenges and thought process</h2>
        <p>
            My thought process for this project involved breaking down the project requirements into
            smaller tasks and planning a development roadmap to ensure that I would meet the project goals. <br>I started by
            designing the user interface using HTML and CSS and then using JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic
            functionality to the web application. <br><br>To ensure that the web application was responsive and visually appealing, I 
            used Bootstrap and Font Awesome to provide templates and scalable vector icons.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Ensuring that the cart functionality is fully
            functional and secure. This required implementing payment processing and ensuring that customer information is
            well stored.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Implementing the search functionality in a way that efficiently retrieves relevant
            results and is user-friendly. This required designing a search algorithm that takes into account factors such as
            product name, description, and category.<br><br>
