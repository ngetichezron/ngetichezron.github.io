    <div>
        <h2>Interesting things learnt</h2>
        <p> <strong>React component architecture:</strong> Learnt how to build React components and organize them in a meaningful way, a
            fundamental skill for building any React application.<br>
    
            <strong>State management:</strong> Managing state was a fundamental aspect of building React calculator application.
            Utilized best practices for managing state, such as using immutable data structures and minimizing state
            dependencies.<br>
    
            <strong>User experience design:</strong> Designing a pleasing and easy to use user interface.<br>
    
            <strong>Test-driven development:</strong>
            Learnt to write tests for calculator application as I built it. It helped me to catch bugs early in the
            development process and ensured that the application is robust and reliable.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Summary of the project</h2>
        <p>The project involved building a simple calculator application using React, which includes two components - a Result
        component that displays the output and a Keypad component that displays the calculator buttons. <br>The calculator features
        basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and supports decimal values,
        percentage calculation, inversion of values, reset functionality, and formatting of larger numbers. <br><br>
        
        The development process involved using React component architecture, managing state effectively, designing a
        user-friendly interface, and writing tests to ensure the calculator was and reliable. <br>Various technologies and
        tools such as React, CSS, and HTML were used to develop the application. <br>The project provided me an
        opportunity to learn and develop fundamental skills in React development.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Project's purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the project was to expedite my skills in react by designing and creating a virtual calculator that could perform basic arithmetic
        operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,       
        as well as support decimal values, calculate percentages, invert values, reset functionality, format larger numbers, and
        resize output based on length. <br><br>
        
        The goal was to develop a user-friendly calculator that is both functional and pleasing.
        The project presents an opportunity to gain experience with identifying and creating components, establishing a
        mutual interactive platform, and addressing any issues or bugs that arise.</p>

        <h2>Stacks and technologies used</h2>

        <h3>Front-end</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>React (JavaScript library)</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript (for handling user interactions and calculations)</li>
            

        <h3>Back-end</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js (JavaScript runtime)</li>
            <li>Express.js (Node.js web application framework)</li>
            <li>REST API (for communication between front-end and back-end)</li>
            
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Webstack and explanation</h2>
        <p>The front-end development involved building the user interface and handling user interactions. <br>React is a popular choice
        for building interactive user interfaces, and was used to create the various components of the calculator. 
        HTML and CSS were used to structure and style the calculator's layout and appearance,
        while JavaScript was used to handle user input and perform calculations.<br><br>
        
        For the back-end development, Node.js and Express.js was used to create a server that handles the calculator's
        functionalities, such as storing and retrieving data, and performing calculations. <br>REST API was created to enable
        communication between the front-end and back-end, allowing user to make calculations and retrieve the results.<br><br>
        
        Git was used for version control to keep track of changes made to the code. <br>npm was used to manage dependencies and
        install necessary libraries. Visual Studio Code was used to write and debug the code.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and thought process</h2>
        <p>        
        <strong>Handling user input:</strong> Handling user input in a robust and error-free way was one of my major challenges that I encountered
        when developing the project. <br>Careful validation and error handling was required to ensure that the application can
        handle invalid characters and unsupported calculations accurately and gracefully.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Managing state:</strong> Managing state can be challenging in React, especially when building a calculator.<br>
        The application needs to keep track of the current state of the calculation, the operator that was last pressed, and the
        previous results. <br>Careful management of state is necessary to ensure that the application performs as expected and that
        the user experience is smooth and seamless. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Styling the application:</strong> The calculator needs to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.<br> Designing a user
        interface that is simple, clear, and easy to understand can be challenging, especially when dealing with multiple
        components and interactions.<br> Attention to detail is required to ensure that the application is both functional and
        visually appealing.<br>
        
        Developing a React calculator application requires a solid understanding of front-end development, as well as
        careful attention to detail and user experience. By carefully managing user input, state, and application styling, an
        intermediate developer can create a robust and user-friendly calculator application.</p>
