        <h2>Summary of the project</h2>
        <p>
            The React weather application project involved developing a web application that allows users to input their country
            name and city and get the weather details of their locality. <br>The application utilizes a weather API to fetch accurate
            and up-to-date weather data and displays the information on the screen in a readable format.<br><br>
            
            To develop the application, several technologies and stacks were used: React for building the user interface,
            JavaScript for programming the application logic, HTML and CSS for creating the markup structure and styling the web
            pages, weather API for fetching weather data, JSON for parsing data obtained from the API, and Git for version control
            and collaboration.<br><br>
            
            The main challenge in this project was working with the weather API, which involved handling HTTP requests, parsing JSON data,
            and handling errors. Other challenges included handling user input validation and optimizing the application's
            performance.<br><br>

        <h2>Project's purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The purpose and goal of the project was to enhance my react knowledge by building a weather app that allows users to get
        weather details of their locality by inputting the country name and city. <br>I also aimed to provide users with
        up-to-date weather information by utilizing a weather API.</p>

        <h2>Webstack and explanation</h2>
        <p>Several stacks and technologies were used to develop the Weather Application. React was used to build the user interface
        of the web application. <br>React provided a way to create reusable components that are composed together to create the
        various views. <br>JavaScript was used to program the application logic, including handling user input and
        data processing. <br>HTML was used to create the markup structure of the web pages, while CSS was used to style the web
        pages.<br><br>
        
        Weather API was used to fetch weather data for the user's locality based on their input. The API provides weather data
        in JSON format, which I parsed using JavaScript. I used Axios to make HTTP requests to the API,
        retrieve the data, and display it on the application's user interface.<br><br>
        
        Git was used for version control and to manage changes. Node.js was used to run the application on the server, and NPM
        was used for package management, which allowed me to install and manage third-party libraries used in the project.<br><br>

        <h2>Challenges and thought process</h2>
        <p>My thought process for developing the project was to break it down into
        smaller tasks and prioritize them based on their importance and dependencies:<br><br>
        
        The first step was to set up the development environment by installing the necessary tools.<br>
        
        The next step was to design the user interface of the application using React components, HTML, and CSS. This involved
        creating a form that allowed users to input their country name and city and then display the weather information on the
        screen in a readable format.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Challenge 1</strong> Working with the weather API.<br>
        Depending on the API's documentation and requirements, I had to register for an API key, authenticate requests,
        and limit the number of requests made.<br>
        Parsing the data obtained from the API and displaying it in a readable format was also a bit of a challenge because of
        the nested nature of the data, and also its complex structure.<br><br><br>
        
        <strong>Challenge 2</strong> Handling user input validation to ensure that the inputted country name and city are
        valid and recognized by the weather API. <br>I had to consider various scenarios, such as handling typos or misspelled
        names, displaying error messages to users, and preventing the application from crashing.<br><br><br>
