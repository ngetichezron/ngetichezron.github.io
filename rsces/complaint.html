        <h2>Interesting things learnt</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Advanced Python concepts:</strong> Learnt advanced Python concepts such as object-oriented programming, decorators, context
            managers, and generators, which would enhance my overall understanding of the language and make me a more efficient
            developer.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Database optimization techniques:</strong> Learnt optimization techniques such as indexing and normalization to ensure that the
            database operates efficiently and provides fast and reliable access to complaint data.<br><br>
            
            <strong>GUI design patterns:</strong> Designing a user-friendly GUI required knowledge of GUI design patterns such as
            Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). Learning these patterns would enabled me to build an
            efficient and scalable GUI for the Complaint Management System project.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Software development best practices:</strong> Version control, testing,
            debugging, and documentation. These practices helped me to write cleaner and more maintainable code, catch errors early
            in the development process, and ensure that the project is well-documented and easy to maintain.<br><br>

        <h2>Summary of the project</h2>
        <p>
            Complaint Management System project is a simple desktop application developed using Python 
            with a Tkinter graphical user interface (GUI) and a SQLite3 database for storing and managing complaint data. <br>The goal
            of the project was to expand my python programming knowledge as well as provide an efficient and intuitive platform for managing customer complaints, improving customer
            satisfaction, and streamlining the complaint resolution process.<br><br>
            
            The project involved developing multiple components, including the GUI, database interface, application logic, and
            required a thorough understanding of Python, SQLite3 database and GUI design principles.<br>
            Throughout the development process, testing and debugging were critical to ensuring that the application worked as
            intended and that any errors were identified and resolved.<br><br>

        <h2>Project's purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of the Complaint Management System project was to advance my python and SQL programming knowledge
        by creating a platform for managing complaints received from customers or users. <br>The system allows users to submit their
        complaints, and the system administrators can process and resolve them efficiently. <br> The project also aimed to streamline the
        complaint management process and improve customer satisfaction by providing timely and effective resolution of
        complaints.</p>

        <h2>Stacks and technologies used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Python </li>
            <li>SQLite3 database</li>
            <li>Tkinter GUI library for Python</li>
            
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Webstack and explanation</h2>
        <p>
            To develop the project, Python was used as the primary language to write the scripts and build the logic of the
            application.<br><br>
            
            SQLite3 database was used to store and manage the data,. SQLite3 is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained
            database that is widely used in desktop and mobile applications. <br>The database is stored in a file, making it easy to
            transport and use across different platforms. <br>Use of SQLite3 enabled efficient storage and retrieval
            of complaint data.<br><br>
            
            Tkinter, a Python GUI library, was used to create the graphical user interface for the Complaint Management System
            project. <br>Tkinter offers a range of widgets and tools for building interactive graphical interfaces. With
            Tkinter, developers can create forms, menus, buttons, text fields, and other graphical components to build an intuitive
            user interface for the application.<br><br>

        <h2>Challenges and thought process</h2>
        <p>
            My thought process for developing this project was as follows:<br><br>
        
            <strong>Understanding the project requirements:</strong> The first step was to fully understand the project requirements in order to ensure that
            the project's scope was clear. <br>This involved reviewing the project brief, visualizing stakeholders, and identifying any
            gaps or ambiguities in the requirements.<br>
            
            <strong>Designing the application architecture:</strong> Once the requirements were clear, the next step was to design the application
            architecture. <br>This involved deciding on the components and modules required and determining the
            interdependencies between them.<br>
            
            <strong>Developing the application components:</strong> I then proceeded to develop the individual components of the application,
            starting with the GUI, followed by the database interface, and then the logic of the application.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Testing and debugging:</strong> Testing and debugging was a critical part of the development process. It ensured that the
            application worked as intended and that any bugs or errors were identified and resolved as early as possible.<br><br>
            
            
            
            Some of the challenges that I encountered during the development process were:<br><br>
            
            <strong>Database integration issues:</strong> The integration of the SQLite3 database with the application was a bit of a challenge,
            particularly with regards to the efficient retrieval and storage of complaint data.<br>
            
            <strong>GUI design challenges:</strong> Designing a user-friendly graphical user interface was challenging due to the complex data
            structures and large amounts of information.<br>
            
            <strong>Debugging and testing difficulties:</strong> Debugging and testing the application was time-consuming and challenging probably
            because of the complex logic and database interactions.<br>
